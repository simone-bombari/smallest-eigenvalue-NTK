# smallest-eigenvalue-NTK

Code for the experiments in the paper the submitted paper.

The two main files are the scripts to perform the two experiments showed in Fig1 and Fig2.

The argument taken by main_eigenvalue.py just defines the output file where the data is saved.
The argument taken by main_optimization.py also defines which Ns are used for the plot. Useful to run the experiment in parallel.

plot.ipynb is a jupyter notebook helpful for plotting the generated data.
